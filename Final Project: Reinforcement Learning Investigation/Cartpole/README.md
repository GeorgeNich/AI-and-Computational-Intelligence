# Cartpole Reinforcement Learning Investigation

## Project Overview
Welcome to the Cartpole project, a part of the Reinforcement Learning Investigation series. This project explores the implementation of reinforcement learning algorithms in solving the Cartpole problem, a classic challenge in the field of AI.

## Project Objectives
- To demonstrate the application of reinforcement learning techniques.
- To compare different strategies, such as Q-learning and random policy, in solving the Cartpole challenge.
- To provide an educational insight into the mechanics of reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Key Components

### CartPoleQLEARNING.py
This script implements Q-learning, a model-free reinforcement learning algorithm, to balance a pole on a moving cart. Key aspects:
- **Algorithm**: Q-learning.
- **Goal**: To maximize the time the pole remains upright.
- **Strategy**: Optimize the cart's movements based on reward feedback.

### CartpoleRandompolicy(300timestep).py
This script employs a random policy to solve the Cartpole problem, serving as a baseline for performance comparison. Key aspects:
- **Approach**: Random action selection.
- **Purpose**: To establish a baseline for evaluating more sophisticated algorithms.

## Methodology
- The project uses the OpenAI Gym environment to simulate the Cartpole problem.
- Different reinforcement learning algorithms are implemented and tested.
- Performance metrics such as time steps the pole remained upright and the total reward are analyzed.

## Insights and Learning Outcomes
- The effectiveness of Q-learning in a practical scenario.
- Understanding the impact of algorithm choice on the performance in reinforcement learning tasks.
- Gaining insights into the challenges and considerations in applying reinforcement learning.
