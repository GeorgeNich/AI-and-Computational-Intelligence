# Mountain Car Reinforcement Learning

## Project Overview
In the Mountain Car project, part of the Reinforcement Learning Investigation series, we delve into the Mountain Car problem, a standard benchmark in reinforcement learning. This project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning algorithms to enable a car to drive up a steep hill.

## Project Objectives
- To explore reinforcement learning techniques in solving the Mountain Car problem.
- To understand the dynamics of training an agent in an environment with continuous state spaces.
- To showcase the application of these techniques in a practical, simulation-based scenario.

## Key Component

### `mountaincar.py`
This script is the core of the Mountain Car project. It implements a reinforcement learning algorithm to solve the challenge where a car must drive up a steep hill. Key aspects of this script include:
- **Algorithm Implementation**: Details on the specific reinforcement learning algorithm used.
- **Simulation Environment**: Utilization of the OpenAI Gym environment for simulating the Mountain Car problem.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analysis of the agent's performance, including its ability to solve the problem within a given number of timesteps.

## Methodology
- The project uses the OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car environment as a testing ground for reinforcement learning algorithms.
- The script iteratively trains an agent to learn the optimal actions to reach the goal.
- Emphasis is placed on the learning process and the agent's improvement over time.

## Insights and Learning Outcomes
- A deeper understanding of how reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied to problems with continuous state spaces.
- Insights into the challenges of training an agent in an environment where the goal is not immediately reachable.
- Observations on the effectiveness and limitations of the applied algorithm in this specific context.
