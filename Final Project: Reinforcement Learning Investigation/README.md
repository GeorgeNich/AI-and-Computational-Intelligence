# Final Project: Reinforcement Learning Investigation

Welcome to the "Reinforcement Learning Investigation" section of the AI and Computational Intelligence repository. This part of the repository is dedicated to exploring various reinforcement learning challenges and solutions. It consists of projects that apply reinforcement learning techniques to solve different problems, each demonstrating unique aspects of the field.

## Projects Overview

### [Taxi Problem](Taxi_Problem/)
- **Description**: The Taxi Problem project explores the use of Q-learning, a fundamental reinforcement learning technique, for solving the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI Gym.
- **Key Components**:
  - `RLQLEARNING_Can_without_full-Q_Table.py`: Implementation of Q-learning without the need for a full Q-table.
  - `RLQlearning_needfullQtable.py`: Implementation requiring a full Q-table.
  - `bruteforce.py`: A brute force approach to the problem.
- [Read More](Taxi_Problem/README.md)

### [Mountain Car](Mountain_Car/)
- **Description**: This project tackles the Mountain Car problem, another classic problem in reinforcement learning, where a car must drive up a steep hill.
- **Key Components**:
  - `mountaincar.py`: The main script for the Mountain Car solution.
- [Read More](Mountain_Car/README.md)

### [Cartpole](Cartpole/)
- **Description**: The Cartpole project focuses on balancing a pole on a moving cart, a benchmark problem in reinforcement learning.
- **Key Components**:
  - `CartPoleQLEARNING.py`: Implementation using Q-learning.
  - `CartpoleRandompolicy(300timestep).py`: A random policy approach to the Cartpole problem.
- [Read More](Cartpole/README.me)
