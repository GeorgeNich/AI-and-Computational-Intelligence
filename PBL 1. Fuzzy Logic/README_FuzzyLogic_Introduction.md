# Fuzzy Logic Automatic Braking Controller

## Introduction
Welcome to the Fuzzy Logic Automatic Braking Controller project, part of the `AI-and-Computational-Intelligence` series. This project aims to implement an intelligent Automatic Braking System using Fuzzy Logic. Our goal is to make informed decisions about braking, taking into account varying distances and speeds, similar to the decision-making process of an autonomous car.

## Project Structure
The project is organized as follows:

- `PBL1_Fuzzy_Logic_Automatic_Braking_Controller.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the comprehensive implementation of the fuzzy logic controller, complete with detailed explanations and interactive visualizations.
- `README_FuzzyLogic_Introduction.md`: You are currently reading this introductory guide, which provides an overview of the project.
- `SIT215_PBL1_Fuzzy_Car_Control_Report.pdf`: For a deeper dive into the project, you can explore our comprehensive report. It covers the project's background, methodology, results, and conclusions.

## Features
Our project includes the following key features:

- **Fuzzy Logic Controller**: We have implemented a sophisticated fuzzy logic system to calculate the optimal braking force based on vehicle speed and distance from an obstacle.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: The notebook includes insightful plots and interactive widgets that showcase how the system responds to different scenarios.
- **Simulation**: We have conducted real-world scenario simulations to rigorously test the effectiveness and reliability of the fuzzy logic controller.

## Getting Started
To run this project, you'll need a Python environment with the necessary libraries installed, including `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-fuzzy`. Follow these steps to get started:

### Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your machine. To install the required libraries, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib scikit-fuzzy

### Running the Notebook
Open the Jupyter notebook named `PBL1_Fuzzy_Logic_Automatic_Braking_Controller.ipynb` in your Jupyter environment to access the code, detailed explanations, and interactive visualizations.
