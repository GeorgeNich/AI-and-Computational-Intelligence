# Fuzzy Car Control README

This README provides a brief overview of the Fuzzy Car Control project, its structure, and key components.

## Project Overview

The Fuzzy Car Control project aims to create an Automatic Braking System using a Fuzzy Logic Controller. This system enhances safety by adjusting braking force based on vehicle speed and distance from obstacles.

## Repository Structure

- **PBL1_Fuzzy_Logic_Automatic_Braking_Controller.ipynb**: The Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for the Fuzzy Logic Controller implementation and simulations.

## Implementation Details

- **Defining Fuzzy Sets and Membership Functions**: Linguistic variables and membership functions for distance, speed, and brake force.
- **Establishing Rules for Fuzzy Logic Control**: Key rules that determine brake force based on inputs.
- **Visualizations of Membership Functions**: Graphical representation of membership functions.
- **Interactive Widget for Testing**: A tool for testing and visualizing controller behavior.

## Design of the Fuzzy Inference System

- **Rules for Fuzzy Logic Control**: Rules for braking based on distance and speed.
- **Visualizations of Membership Functions**: Graphs depicting fuzzy sets.

## Simulation and Analysis

- **Simulation of Fuzzy Logic Controller**: Testing and simulating the controller's behavior.
- **Analysis of Controller Performance**: Assessing the effectiveness of the controller.

## Contributions

- **Team Collaboration**: Collaboration within the project team.
- **Roles and Contributions**: Individual contributions and responsibilities.
