# Final Project: Reinforcement Learning Investigation

## Introduction
Welcome to the "Reinforcement Learning Investigation" project. This repository houses a series of Problem-Based Learning (PBL) projects focusing on different aspects and applications of Reinforcement Learning and AI. Each sub-project explores unique challenges and solutions in the field, demonstrating practical implementations and theoretical insights.

## Projects Overview

### [PBL 1. Fuzzy Logic](PBL%201.%20Fuzzy%20Logic/)
- **Topic**: Fuzzy Logic Automatic Braking Controller
- **Description**: Implementation of an intelligent Automatic Braking System using Fuzzy Logic.
- **Key Features**: Interactive implementation, comprehensive explanations, and simulation of real-world scenarios.
- [Read More](PBL%201.%20Fuzzy%20Logic/README.md)

### [PBL 2. Knight's Tour](PBL%202.%20Knights%20Tour/)
- **Topic**: Solving the Knight's Tour Problem
- **Description**: A Python program to solve the Knight's Tour problem on an n x n chessboard using an efficient backtracking algorithm.
- **Key Features**: Interactive GUI, algorithm analysis, and performance metrics.
- [Read More](PBL%202.%20Knights%20Tour/README.md)

### [PBL 3. Game of Nim](PBL%203.%20Game%20of%20Nim/)
- **Topic**: The Game of Nim
- **Description**: Players compete against a computer AI in the classic strategy game of Nim.
- **Key Features**: AI opponent using the Minimax algorithm, configurable game settings, and strategic gameplay.
